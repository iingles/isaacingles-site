I am writing a personal history in order to get better at emoting myself through the written word. I was born on the stormy weekend of May 23, 1983, at Cottonwood Hospital in Murray, Utah.  I came out via C-Section; I was born breech with my umbilical cord wrapped around my neck.  I weighed in at 8 pounds 9 ounces.  My mother told me that my grandma Ingles said I looked just like my daddy. The next fundamental event in my life took place in about December of 1983.  I am told that my oldest brother, Nathaniel, then 4 years old, liked to collect and carry pennies around the house.  At some point I found one of them, and like infants do, swallowed it.  It lodged in my throat, impairing my breathing.  My mother told me that when I began wheezing, she took me to the doctor.  The doctors took an x-ray and diagnosed me with pneumonia, then sent me home with a prescription for antibiotics.  A week or so later, my wheezing had become worse; so my mother took me back to the doctor.  The doctor, who had called a colleague in, told my mom that he ought to turn her in for allowing me to catch pneumonia and letting it get so bad.  They gave me stronger antibiotics and sent me home. After another few weeks, my wheezing had become worse still; and my lips began to turn blue.  Finally, my mother took me to Primary Children’s Medical Center in Salt Lake City, where as she brought me in the door to the emergency room, the triage nurse said, “What did that baby swallow?” The doctors at Primary Children’s stuck a tube down my throat and took the penny out, and from my father’s account, I recovered quite quickly, jumping up and down in the crib just hours after the surgery.The next event, which is probably my first memory, took place in Missouri, sometime in June 1984.  Me and my brother were pulling pots and pans out of my grandma’s cupboards.  I sat in one of the pots, and I can vividly remember that I was pretending that my brother was cooking me.  The funny thing about this memory is that I don’t think I comprehended that I was over 1200 miles away from home; in my mind I was still back at the house in Bountiful. I can remember my second Christmas, December 1985.  I got a Fisher Price Main Street and a Fisher Price Zoo set, with all of the little people.  I can also remember I was wearing footie pajamas.  I remember that footie pajamas were my favorite; I’m pretty sure I had several pairs, and I can remember that I was sad when I finally outgrew them.My third Christmas, I got a fire engine and a fireman’s hat.  I used to sit in the diaper boxes and put the fire engine in the front like I was driving it.  This same year I can also remember wearing plastic training pants that gave me a really bad diaper rash.  I can also remember my dad taking me for rides around the backyard on his Yamaha motorcycle; the seat was covered with an old pair of cut up jeans.  I’m pretty sure that I got a new tricycle for my birthday this year.I continued to grow; I am told that even though I learned how to talk at about the normal time, I was very quiet.  I would point to an object, and one of my brothers would ask me if I wanted it; and I would nod.  I know that I liked to wander off, away from my house and explore the neighborhood.  There are two distinct times that stand out in memory.  The first time, I was about four years old, and I didn’t want to wait for my mom to get home from work anymore.  So I walked away from the house, three blocks down to Main Street (which was quite heavily trafficked), and sat on the bus bench in front of the Bountiful Tabernacle.  I turned around and “read” the words on the bench, in my mind I made the characters say, “Wait for mommy”.  I’m pretty sure I even said this aloud.   After waiting for several minutes, I turned around and made my way back home.  When I got home, I opened the back door to see my mother standing at the top of the stairs glaring down at me.  I was “grounded” to one of the bedrooms downstairs as my mom conducted a den meeting for my oldest brother, Nathaniel.  I can remember one of the boys asked what I had done wrong, and my brother answered that I had walked all the way down to Main Street by myself.  The boy commented, “Oh, that busy street?”.The second time that I can remember, I was still four.  Our Collie, McGee had run away.  We were being babysat because my mom was at work.  I decided that I was going to go out on my own and search for McGee by myself.  It must have been summertime because my brothers were out of school.  I took the dog’s collar and wandered around the neighborhood, crossing the busy street of 400 North in Bountiful and ending up on one of the islands near the Main Street and 400 North intersection.  I can remember a nice lady came and took me by the hand, then let me ride in her blue convertible with a young man, I presume it was a son of hers.  She took me to the Bountiful Police Station where they let me play with a hat.   I was sitting up on the counter as my mom walked in, tears streaming down her face.  My mother has told me that a police officer whom lived in our neighborhood, Grand Hodgeson, had seen her outside of the station and jokingly said, “Take that one away, put her away for a long time!” as she walked inside.  I remember I was playing with a set of keys when my mom came to pick me up from the counter.  Her eyes were wet with tears.  When my mother took my sister to Missouri, my dad took me and my two brothers, Nathaniel and Joshua, to the pet store to pick out a guinea pig.  Which we only had for about four days before I sat on it and it died.  I can remember picking up it&#039;s lifeless corpse, and seeing some kind of fluid dripping out of its anus.  I put it back in its cage, which was in my sister&#039;s room, and walked in the bathroom to where my dad was taking a bath, and told him that the guniea pig wasn&#039;t moving.  My dad got dressed and got the pig out of it&#039;s cage, I can remember him taking it outside and putting it on the trunk of the old Chevy Nova, and lifting it up a few times to check if it was really dead.  He then dug a hole next to the driveway and buried it.My mother used to hand-make clothing for me.  I can remember the shiny blue, red, or yellow buttons that she would sew onto the shirts.  She did this until I was about six years old; I can remember an outfit with a white background and multi-colored dinosaur shapes in particular.  I can also remember a yellow shirt and pants, and a red shirt and pants.  My Grandma Ingles made a quilt for me when I was about five years old; it was blue on one side and had football players and pennants on the other; it also had a red border and red yarn ties.    When I was about five years old my parents got me a desk that had a chair attached to it.  There was a chalkboard on one side and a corkboard on the other side.  I also got an eraser and tons of chalk.  It’s funny, I can hardly remember a cloudy day from those early years of my life.  All of these memories are bright and sunny; like the first five or six years were nothing but endless summer days.  I can remember my first day of Kindergarten.  They took us on a tour around the school.  When I saw the swings and the monkey bars, I ran away from the group to play, but was immediately called back by the teacher.  My kindergarten teacher’s name was Mrs. Kopp, who was standing in for the full-time teacher, Mrs. Henderson, while Mrs. Henderson was having back surgery.  There was also a day where my Grandma Ingles had promised to pick me up from school and take me to lunch.  I anticipated this all day, but when school was over, it was my mother that came and picked me up.  She told me that my Grandma was sick and couldn’t take me.  My mother told me that I had “eyes as big as a moons” when she told me.  I can also remember a pair of yellow mittens that my grandma knitted me.  I can remember Bishop Hart, who was the Bishop of my LDS ward for most of my middle childhood (he was preceded by Lane Beattie and succeeded by Douglas Fenwick).  He had a garden that he would often invite the children in the neighborhood to come help him in.  I can still remember his wrinkled face and his kind eyes behind his large glasses.  I can remember him giving me peas to eat straight from his garden.  I loved popping them out of the pod to eat them.  His wife said that I had “chocolate drop eyes”.  He lived kitty corner to my house.  He died at some point in my late adolescence; I can remember my brother Joshua crying when he heard the news.There was a large field across the street from my house, in addition to my backyard, it served as a playground for my siblings and other kids in the neighborhood.  There were several cherry trees; two of them were what we considered “climbable”.  Bountiful used to have a lot of orchards, I’m assuming that these cherry trees were the remnants a larger parcel of land that used to be one of those orchards.I remember one day in second grade, I brought a friend, Isaac Stevens, home with me.  We went across the street to the “field”, as it was called, and I showed him several pieces of discarded flooring that I wanted to make into a “stage”, where we could put on shows.  He wasn’t entertained by the idea, so we went back to my house and watched TV until it was time for him to go home.  In the fall of 1990, a yellow tabby that we called “Kitty” that would frequent our house (I had always assumed that it was a stray cat, but my mother later told me that she had bought it several years earlier and it had turned semi-wild) was hit by a car on 400 East and had had it’s body parts thrown all over the road.  As Josh and I were walking home from school, we saw the cat in the road.  Josh ran over to it to investigate, while I ran home crying.  I can remember looking out the window to where our black lab Tipper was chained, crying, and telling tipper that “The kitty is dead”.  I can also remember repeating, “I can’t believe that I held a cat yesterday that is dead now” over and over again.For several months after this, I had nightmares of finding the cat’s rotting carcass all over my house, at my school, and in my bed.  I had a dream that a tiny yellow cat would chase me around my school.  This kept me awake multiple nights in a row; my mom noticed but I never really told her what was bothering me.In second grade I befriended a several other boys, in particular, Matt Allen, Brent Hill, and a kid named Shane (I forgot his last name).  Matt was from a single parent family, and had an older sister.  He lived in the apartments behind Paces DairyAnn in Bountiful.  I went to his apartment once; he showed me all of his star wars toys, and we played ninja.  Then we had some cereal, and it was time to go home.  Before I had gone to his apartment, in my imagination I had pictured him living in a lavish mansion and changing out of his school clothes into a blue, sparkling tuxedo.  I think the reason that Matt and I had become friends is because we both liked “play fighting”; that is, wrestling and playing like we knew karate (although he did know karate and I didn’t).  By the beginning of my third grade year, Matt had developed a severe dislike for me, and we were no longer friends.I remember getting glasses in the third grade, and my teacher, Mrs. Keeley, told me that I had joined a club for people with glasses, of which she was a member.  My third grade year, school ran two weeks longer into the summer than usual; much of the class grew antsy and disruptive; and basically gave up on school.  I can remember the teacher yelling at us that we were still in school until the middle of June.Near the end of the Fourth Grade, I got contact lenses.  I can remember the first time I tried to put them in, I kept telling the doctor and my mom that there were &quot;fumes&quot; coming off of the lens as I held it on my finger with the conditioning fluid on it.  I had to try multiple times before actually getting the lens on.  I can remember how much it hurt taking the lenses out, before I had grown callouses on the inside of my eyelids.

In my independent studies as I prepare for yet another bout of college classes, every day I am reminded of how much practice we need at a subject before we are able to master it; and even once we have mastered it, how much practice it takes to maintain that level of mastery.  Indeed, it seems as though this is an inherent part of the human condition; something that cannot be ignored or bypassed if we seek to be successful.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Mar 17, 2010, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Mar 17, 2010, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">A quickly written version of a better story for the Star Wars prequels (in my humble opinion)</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>
I&#039;m a total nerd for doing this, but I think it makes a lot more sense than the anal leakage that George Lucas produced a little over ten years ago.  Why do I bother?  Because Star Wars is more than a set of 3 movies (and there are only 3 movies); in a lot of ways it defined a whole new generation of film, and a new generation of artists and filmmakers. You should really only read this if you&#039;re a Star Wars fan; if you&#039;re not, you probably won&#039;t get most of it. 

________________________________________________________________________________


During the Clone Wars vs. the Mandalores, it is suspected that a new conglomorate of Sith is behind the uprising against the Republic. General Obi-Wan Kenobi is summoned by Master Yoda to infiltrate the underworld and if he finds a community of Sith, to join up with them and act as a double agent. Obi Wan is trained for two years in dark side defense techniques and in ways to keep his true feelings from others. Along the way he hitches a ride on a spice freighter, where he meets the young navigator, Anakin Skywalker. During the freighter&#039;s excursion into enemy space it is attacked, and the flight crew, except for Anakin is killed. Anakin manages to use his piloting skills to save himself and Obi-Wan. Obi Wan senses great power flowing from Anakin; and makes the decision to try and train him as a Jedi. Anakin&#039;s skill is exceptional; he is forced to separate from Obi-Wan when Obi-Wan finally infiltrates the Sith. Anakin can feel the force, but he cannot control it. Anakin is especially vulnerable at this stage, and when he meets a young woman whom coaxes him into learning the dark side, he cannot resist. Back on Coruscant, It is revealed that Yoda sent Obi-Wan on a mission to learn the dark side, something that has been explicitly forbidden by the Jedi Council. Yoda is exiled to the remote world of Dagobah where Obi-Wan meets with him.  Obi-wan is still struggling with the dark side, and meditates with Yoda to completely free himself from it in a cave on Dagobah; Obi-Wan releases his dark Sith energy into the cave. Meanwhile, after making love to the dark Jedi who trained him, Anakin kills her in a fit of rage and flees the system, meeting up with Obi-Wan at a pre-determined rendezvous. Obi-Wan is left with no allies back on Coruscant because the Council believes they cannot trust a Jedi who has given into the dark side. Obi-Wan defeats a Sith Lord with the latent help of Anakin (who wanted the Sith Lord dead so that he could take his place) and the two of them return to the core systems. Obi-Wan attempts to continue Anakin&#039;s training, but both of them must keep a low profile because Obi-Wan is seen as a traitor and Anakin is a known pirate. Because of Obi-Wan&#039;s service as a General, Anakin and Obi-Wan finally find allies on Alderaan, where Anakin falls for the daughter of the Alderanian King. The two of them share forbidden love in the garden one evening, and Anakin unknowingly impregnates her. The Jedi Council, believing that Obi-Wan is a Sith Lord, have sent bounty hunters through the galaxy to attempt to terminate him. Obi-Wan flees Alderaan and is forced to battle one of his old friends, and subdues him. Anakin, who can afford to be more anonymous, stays behind and meets a Senator Palpatine on Alderaan. The two of them begin to meet in private while Obi-Wan continues to flee from the Jedi-Council&#039;s bounty hunters as well as Jedi that have been sent to kill him. Palpatine makes Anakin his personal bodyguard and the two return to Coruscant. Obi-Wan returns to Alderaan to find Anakin missing and his lover pregnant. News comes from the core systems of the collapse of central control on Coruscant, and the Jedi Council has been murdered. Senator Palpatine has seized control with a mixed army of Mandalores and Clones, and has a Darth Vader at his side, assisting him in killing off the remaining Jedi on Coruscant. Obi-wan realizes that Vader is really Anakin and curses himself for training him. Obi-Wan realizes that Anakin&#039;s seed must never come to the attention of the newly proclaimed Emperor or to Anakin; so the two are split up; Leia is to be raised as another daughter of the King of Alderaan, while Luke, believed to be the stronger of the two, is taken by Obi-Wan to the remote planet Tatooine, where Obi-Wan drops him off at the Lars homestead; the Lars are old friends of Obi-wan with whom he has had a sort of falling out. Fearing that he is the last of the Jedi (besides the stranded Yoda), Obi-Wan resumes his old duty as a Jedi Knight and protector of the Republic and leaves Tatooine; driving his ship right into the middle of the civil war on Coruscant, where he fights his way to where Vader is. They fight in a foundry, where Obi-Wan causes a vat of molten metal to pour all over Anakin; Palpatine manages to shield Anakin at the last moment and Obi-Wan is overwhelmed by Mandalores and forced to retreat.  Ashamed and beaten, Obi-Wan returns to Tatooine to oversee Luke&#039;s growth and development, but is told by the Lars family that Luke will have nothing to do with him or the Jedi.  Obi Wan, without a functional ship or any other real means of getting off of the planet, takes up residence in the Judland Wastes, not too far from the Lars homestead to watch over Luke from a distance.  </div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Feb 7, 2010, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Feb 6, 2010, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Star Wars Rant</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>
(23:17) isaac_ingles: so, I&#039;ve been thinking...Why did George Lucas go through the trouble of designing all these new starships for the prequel trilogy?  And why did they look more advanced than the ones in the original trilogy?
(23:19) isaac_ingles: I mean, the Y-wing fighter supposedly &quot;came to prominance&quot; during the clone wars.
(23:20) isaac_ingles: and if Lucas was going to use things from the expanded universe, why didn&#039;t he also use the Z-95 headhunter, the predecessor to the X-Wing?
(23:21) isaac_ingles: I mean, if he had made the starships look older and clunkier, I think it would have given the series a little more charm.
(23:24) isaac_ingles: not to mention the predecessor to the Imperial star destroyer, the Victory-class.
(23:24) isaac_ingles: I mean, there was already all of this backstory there.
(23:38) isaac_ingles: I guess there was the Venator-class star destroyer...but even those look significantly different than the Victory class ones.  I think that he should have just stuck with the victory class ones...I mean, look at our modern military, have ship and fighter designs changed that much in the last 20 years?
(23:39) maximus_84010: Because he&#039;s an idiot. 
(23:39) isaac_ingles: *sigh*
(23:39) isaac_ingles: what an asshole.
(23:42) isaac_ingles: I&#039;m starting to remember why I stopped paying attention to star wars.
(23:43) isaac_ingles: It had so much potential...
(23:43) isaac_ingles: and was completely ruined.
(23:43) isaac_ingles: and like Plinkett said, it can never be undone.

---


(10:51) isaac_ingles: Star Wars...maybe that&#039;s why I&#039;ve been so depressed for the past 10 years.
(10:52) isaac_ingles: It practically raised me through my adolescence.
(10:52) isaac_ingles: and then...and then...
(10:52) isaac_ingles: I mean, I&#039;ve kind of blocked it out.  Forgotten about it.  But reading all these technical specifications and expanded universe stories is causing everything to flood back.
(10:52) isaac_ingles: And I&#039;m angry.
(10:53) isaac_ingles: Damn you, George Lucas.
(10:53) isaac_ingles: Damn...you..to hell.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Jan 27, 2010, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Jan 27, 2010, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">&#039;Twas the Night before Christmas</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>

And the nurse in her sweater, and me in my coat

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/PaleBlueDot.jpg   

 Look again at that dot. That&#039;s here. That&#039;s home. That&#039;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &quot;superstar,&quot; every &quot;supreme leader,&quot; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

    The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

    Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

    The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

    It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we&#039;ve ever known.

&quot;You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the wealthy out of freedom. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is about the end of any nation. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it.&quot;

Today I&#039;m going to attempt and write a brief sentence/paragraph about what I&#039;ve done for my birthdays for the past 26 years; some I remember better than others so we&#039;ll see how well I do.  This is really for myself, I&#039;m sure most people won&#039;t be that interested in it but you can read it if you want.

26:  Spent the morning in downtown London, was robbed of £60 immediately after using an ATM.  There is also an Australian guy staying at my hostel that is trying to convince me to get drunk for the first time.

25:  Went to an italian restaurant in Bountiful with Phil, Remington, and Christy (I think that was it, I don&#039;t remember if anyone else was there.)

24:  Worked a graveyard shift on the Children&#039;s Unit and slept for most of the day; that weekend I think I went to see a  movie with some friends.

23:  Worked a graveyard shift the night before; I&#039;m pretty sure I slept all day.

22:  Was working as a temp worker at Nutraceutical in Park City; they bought me a cake.

21:  Spent the day in Helena, Montana whilst on a deployment in the Army Reserves.  The nice guys down in the mess hall made me a cake and  several of the guys inmy unit took me out for a &quot;fancy&quot; dinner at golden corral.

20:  Went to my brother&#039;s house with Alan, Heidi, Tawnya, Remington and Christy to have a barbecue, and went to see X-Men 2 afterwards.

19:  Got a Star Wars cake that I think my mom paid for (I still have Jango and Obi-wan on top of my monitor); I&#039;m pretty sure me and Phil went to a movie or something.

18:  I don&#039;t think I did much of anything besides work.  How exciting.

17:  Phil bought me a paperback copy of &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot;.  I&#039;m still not sure that I&#039;ve finished it.

16:  I&#039;m not sure what I did in 1999; I do know that this was the summer we made all of those backyard movies with Steve&#039;s camcorder.

15: I think I spent the day at my grandmother&#039;s house and started looking for my first real job.

14: I think I&#039;ve blocked this one out; my world was really chaotic at this point in my life.

13: My dad took me out to dinner at Sizzler.  Honestly, I really never liked Sizzler, I just didn&#039;t want to hurt his feelings.  This was right after my parents were officially divorced so I think he was trying to &quot;mend&quot; the relationship or whatnot.

12:  I got a birthday cake with a rabbit on it; I remember this because I have pictures of it.  I know at the time I felt like I was too old to have a kiddy party so I really didn&#039;t do much; I think we went out to Chuck a Rama.

11:  I didn&#039;t do much on the actual day of my birthday but I had a party towards the end of June where I invited Joe, Brent, Remington, Jessy, and Alex; we went swimming, played video games, and slept in a tent in my backyard.

10:  Me and Jessy went to Pizza Hut; I got a supersoaker and loads of ninja turtles action figures from my grandma in Missouri.

09:  I got a ninja turtle birthday cake (I remember this because of pictures).

08:  I got a book of remembrance and a set of scriptures, both of which I still have.  I know we went to the McLaughlan&#039;s that evening and had dinner.

07:  I can&#039;t quite remember this one.

06:  We went to rocket park in Bountiful; I invited a ton of friends, the ones I remember were Jessy Platt, Alex McLauglan, Jeremy Lawson, Jeff  Smart, Beth Johnson...and a few more that I can&#039;t recall.  Jessy stepped on my cake when she was getting into the back of my dad&#039;s truck from the cab.  I&#039;m still not sure I forgive her for that (sarcasm).  I&#039;m pretty sure I got a cap gun with the paper &quot;roll&quot; caps.

05:  I got a bubbleblower mower; don&#039;t remember much else.

04:  Here&#039;s where they start to get fuzzy.

03:  ...

02:  I know from pictures that we had a party on the front lawn, I&#039;m pretty sure I got a knit basketball and hoop from one person or another.

01:  I know that this was the summer I went to Missouri; I don&#039;t recall much else.

That&#039;s all I remember.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated May 23, 2009, 5:51 AM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">May 23, 2009, 5:51 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">99</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>

You&#039;ve been tagged, you are supposed to write a note with the ABC&#039;s of YOU. At the end, choose 26 people to be tagged. You have to tag me so really you just need 25 more people. If I tagged you, it&#039;s because I want to know more about you - but not in a creepy stalker kind of way.

Sometimes I will spend an hour on a networking site like this, completely abandon it for a month, and then come back and spend another hour.  Why do I even bother if I don&#039;t even use it that much?  I mean, I already have a blog, and all that.  Why am I even on Facebook?  I already deleted my Myspace account.  I guess it&#039;s just kind of fun to do every once and a while...early in the morning, when I can&#039;t sleep - which is often.</div><div class="_2pic"></div><div>Updated Oct 19, 2008, 1:39 AM</div></div><div class="_3-94 _2lem">Oct 19, 2008, 1:39 AM</div></div><div class="pam _3-95 _2pi0 _2lej uiBoxWhite noborder"><div class="_3-96 _2pio _2lek _2lel">Another long week over.</div><div class="_3-96 _2let"><div>
